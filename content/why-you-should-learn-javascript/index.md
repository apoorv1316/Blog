There are so many programming languages that are available and can be read and understood by various computers, the most popular programming languages include; C++, Python, R, and JavaScript.Every language has its advantages and disadvantages; they were developed for a particular reason to help improve the technology of the present day. JavaScript is most of the time been referred to as a starting point for every programmer.

JavaScript was created by Netscape Communication and first appeared in 1995. Its developers define it as a “scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages.” JavaScript makes web pages more dynamic and user-friendly so that they respond to visitors’ actions. Or, to put it another way, JavaScript makes web pages interactive.

The following below are the reasons why you should consider learning JavaScript as a programmer. They are as follows;

### 1\. Beginner Friendly

Javascript is a very beginner-friendly programming language, and everybody can start learning without any previous experience. Taking into consideration that Javascript is mostly focused on front-end development and user interfaces, it would be great to learn HTML and CSS first.

### 2\. It’s the most popular programming language

According to [Stackoverflow.com](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology), JavaScript is the most popular programming language used by professional developers today. Even back-end developers choose JavaScript more often than not.

### **3\. JavaScript is everywhere**

JavaScript is, without question, the default language of the internet. You need to look no further than your browser for proof since JavaScript was most likely used to develop it. Since browsers are a necessary part of any user’s online experience, it’s easy to see why JavaScript is so significant.

JavaScript has many uses that go beyond its traditional internet roles. It powers smart televisions, works with the internet of things (IoT), creates native apps for iOS and Android, and builds cross-platform desktop apps, to name a few.

### 4\. It has an active and vibrant community

As a very popular programming language, Javascript has a very big community of programmers.The JavaScript community provides a benefit that other programming languages fail to provide and consists of over 9 million developers all over the world. This vibrant community consists of active forums to help support every developer in the community. Due to the longtime JavaScript has spent in the tech industry, it is hard to find a JavaScript-related problem in the community because any question you can think of has already been asked by someone else and has also been answered in the same community.

### 5\. Hi**gh demand for JavaScript developers**

With an increasing number of businesses and organizations going digital, there is a corresponding increase in demand for developers who are familiar with the better-known programming languages. As we’ve already noted, that’s JavaScript!. It’s enough to take a look at a few job boards like Monster or Indeed or professional portals like LinkedIn, and you will realize that job offers for programmers with Javascript knowledge are everywhere and it’s one of the most popular programming languages right now.

The above are reasons why every programmer should learn JavaScript, there are many other programming languages to learn but this is a good way to start because no other programming language is as versatile as JavaScript.

**Happy Coding!**
